I would like to stop maintaining this project.  If you would like to
adopt it, please drop me a line, and I'll hand it over.

_diagrams-openscad_ is a very immature backend for [diagrams],
targeting the [OpenSCAD] solid modeler.  Diagrams is a powerful,
flexible, declarative domain-specific language for creating 2D & 3D
graphics, using the [Haskell programming language][haskell].

Right now, to use the 3D portion of this project, it is necessary to
build [diagrams-lib] HEAD.

# TODO
- figure out types for union, intersection
- decide how to specify number of faces for curved surfaces
